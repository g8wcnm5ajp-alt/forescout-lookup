webapp-query.py -- SSH forced-command wrapper for the forescout-lookup
web app's restricted key.

Deployed on the EM (see EM_IP below, detected live via `hostname -I` rather
than hardcoded, since an EM's IP can change over its lifetime) at
/root/scripts/webapp-query/webapp-query.py.
The corresponding authorized_keys line pins every connection using this
key to run ONLY this script:

    command="/root/scripts/webapp-query/webapp-query.py",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAA...

SSH sets $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND to whatever the client actually asked
for; this script ignores everything else and validates that string
against a strict allow-list before doing anything. This is a command
allow-list, not a privilege reduction -- fstool/psql both require root,
so this still runs as root on the EM. What it restricts is WHAT can be
asked for, not what privilege level does the asking.

Verbs (see the plan this was built from, forescout-lookup):

                            managed appliance) and returns the parsed
                            errors/<category>/summary.txt tree -- a real,
                            unscoped snapshot that runs several minutes,
                            not a quick check; duration is <N>m or <N>h

Every code path here re-derives which plugin(s)/appliance(s) actually
matter for the given host from live data -- it never assumes the
appliance that answers `fstool hostinfo` locally on the EM is the same
appliance that owns the record. Same three-way assigned-to branch
(this appliance / another appliance / the EM itself) used by
client-activity-log.sh and documented in Host Connection Detail
Analysis.

    guess (which only ever offered sw/dot1x/wireless and missed e.g.
    crowdstrike entirely, matched purely by MAC, unrelated to connection
    medium). Confirmed live: for a real host this correctly surfaces
    crowdstrike, snow, va, ad, classification, goodies, etc alongside
    sw/dot1x whenever those plugins genuinely have data for it -- and by
    the same mechanism will surface dns_client/dhclass whenever a host
    has real DNS/DHCP-sourced fields.

    Target resolution, in priority order:

    1. **Field-source decode** (resolve_source_appliance, same node-ID
    mechanism already used for mac_source_appliance elsewhere) -- trusted
    ONLY when it points to a box OTHER than the host's own local
    appliance. Confirmed live 2026-08-25 (a real host): sw_ip/
    sw_port_desc/sw_hostname/mac are all genuinely source-attributed to
    a DIFFERENT appliance (.213) than the host's own (.212) -- real,
    precise, per-host/per-device evidence a coarse "is this plugin
    enabled anywhere" check can't produce, and exactly what David
    reported was wrong before this. A SAME-box decode is deliberately
    NOT trusted the same way -- confirmed live this is exactly how
    crowdstrike goes wrong: its EM-computed data gets synced into the
    host's local record and re-stamped with the LOCAL box's own node ID,
    making a same-box decode indistinguishable from "genuinely local"
    even when it isn't.

    2. **Live enabled-state** (get_enabled_plugins across EVERY known box,
    get_all_targets) -- the fallback whenever the field-source decode
    didn't produce a trusted cross-box answer. This is what correctly
    catches crowdstrike: its directory is installed identically
    everywhere (get_installed_plugins alone can never distinguish it),
    but it's only genuinely ENABLED on the EM in this deployment, so it
    resolves there regardless of which appliance the host itself is
    assigned to. A plugin can legitimately be enabled on MORE than one
    box at once (confirmed live: most plugins besides crowdstrike show
    enabled=true on the EM AND both appliances in this deployment) -- rather
    than silently guessing one, every genuinely-enabled candidate is
    returned so the caller can offer all of them. do_lookup's
    debug_targets ends up with one row per (plugin, candidate target)
    pair in this case, which the existing plugin-selection table already
    renders as separate, independently checkable rows -- the fallback
    David proposed for whichever plugin/host combination genuinely can't
    be resolved by either signal above.

    3. **Installed-directory check** -- last resort, only if the
    enabled-state check comes back with no candidates at all for a
    plugin that genuinely has real hostinfo data (defensive -- keeps a
    plugin from silently vanishing if `fstool plugin ... list`'s output
    format ever changes). Known on its own to be too coarse to
    distinguish anything (confirmed live: installed directories are
    identical across the EM and every appliance in this lab) -- never
    the primary signal, only a safety net.

    Appliance-addressed debug control -- replaces the IP-addressed

    many looked-up hosts are checked (e.g. two hosts on the same switch
    appliance need only one "sw" row, not two; hosts on different switch
    appliances need one row each), so debug is naturally addressed by
    which box to run it on rather than which host's IP happens to
    resolve there. Level is independently chosen per plugin; duration is
    shared across whichever plugins are checked (David's ask, one dial
    rather than N). Reused for both directions: "Start debug" sends each
    checked plugin's configured level+minutes; "Stop debug now" sends
    the same checked plugins at level=0/minutes=1 (confirmed live this
    disables immediately, not just shortens the timer).

    spec is shape-validated by the caller's regex before this is ever
    reached (safe plugin-name charset, level 0-12, minutes 1-1440), but
    that alone doesn't know which plugin names are real. This checks
    every plugin in spec against the box's actual installed plugin
    directories (get_installed_plugins) UPFRONT, before running

    partially executing.

    this target, every involved host's own hostinfo dump, and every
    requested table all land in a single bundle rather than one bundle
    per plugin -- David's explicit ask, so only one bundle needs building
    per appliance even when several hosts, plugins, or tables are
    involved. Tables come from get_databases (fstool's own `db
    diskspace` -- David's final word, 2026-08-26, after this went
    through a table-vs-whole-database detour the same day: it's tables,
    same as --dbtable always addressed, just fstool's own curated,
    size-ranked significant ones rather than every table in the schema).

    Writes a companion *-commands.txt summary next to the bundle (see
    _write_commands_summary) recording the exact command(s) run and the
    tool's own output, for debugging the collection process itself
    later, then centralizes both files onto the EM's shared case storage

    diskspace` list (get_databases) before use, not just trusted from

    support bundle directly to Forescout." Confirmed live via `fstool
    help tech-support`: --send and --pack are both listed together
    under "Non interactive related options", not documented as mutually
    exclusive, so this ADDS --send alongside the existing --pack rather
    than replacing it -- --pack is what makes fstool actually produce
    the local archive this app's own File:/Size: parsing, centralize,
    and split logic all depend on; if --send alone dropped that, every
    downstream step here would break. This combined-flag behavior has
    NOT been live-fired (unlike everything else in this app, this one
    real-transmits data to Forescout's own external support servers,

    Shared by do_techsupport_preview and do_techsupport_collect --
    fetches each host's own hostinfo and merges every relevant (plugin,
    target) pair (see detect_plugins) into a per-target union across all
    given hosts, so two hosts sharing an appliance (or one host needing
    several plugins on the same box) collapse into one bundle for it.
    Read-only (no side effects besides the hostinfo fetch itself), so
    it's safe to call once for the preview and again, independently,
    when the user actually proceeds -- hostinfo could in principle
    differ slightly between the two calls; accepted as a simplification
    rather than trying to pin state between them.

    selected_plugins: optional {target: set(plugin)} restricting the
    detected set to only what's explicitly checked in the UI -- David's
    ask, plugin inclusion should default to nothing auto-selected rather
    than everything a host happens to touch (same reasoning as the old
    Debug panel's default-unchecked rows: "not all cases it will be
    necessary to set debug on for all plugins... therefore their log
    data will not need to be included in the tech-support bundles").
    Only ever narrows the real, detected set via intersection -- never
    injects a plugin that wasn't genuinely found on that host, so this
    parameter can't be used to smuggle in an arbitrary plugin name. A
    target left with zero plugins after filtering is dropped entirely --
    UNLESS it's some host's own managing appliance (see below), which
    always survives regardless of plugin selection.

    Each host's own hostinfo dump is attached to the bundle on that
    host's own managing appliance (or the EM if managed centrally),
    never to a target its plugins merely fan out to (e.g. crowdstrike
    resolving to the EM, or the switch plugin resolving to whichever
    appliance manages the switch a host connects through) -- confirmed
    with David: those aren't where the host itself lives, so attaching
    its hostinfo there would misrepresent the data's source.

    A bundle on a host's own managing appliance is now ALWAYS built,
    carrying its hostinfo, regardless of whether any selected plugin
    happens to resolve there too (reversed 2026-08-26 -- David's earlier
    call was the opposite, "only if a selected plugin lands there," but
    a real case -- a host whose own appliance had no
    checked plugin landing there since crowdstrike/sw both resolved
    elsewhere -- showed that left the host's own hostinfo with nowhere
    to go at all. Confirmed with David this is the standing rule now: an
    otherwise-empty own-appliance bundle (no -p, fstool's own default
    category set, same shape as the EM's general bundle) is exactly
    what's wanted, not a corner case to avoid).

# oneach` echoes back whatever identifier it targeted (a hostname like "belfscout01" there,
# not an IP), so the old pattern silently matched none of them -- every DNS-named appliance
# showed "offline" in the Appliances tab even though `fstool oneach` reached it fine, and
# get_all_targets() (same regex, used far more broadly -- debug-target selection, plugin
# detection) silently excluded every one of them too. That's the real root cause behind
# "fails to collect host data from the appliances" for DNS-named environments -- distinct
